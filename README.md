# predictive-cost-analysis
Predictive analysis of supply chain costs in the fast fashion industry using statistical models

This project analyzes cost-related challenges in the fast fashion supply chain using predictive analytics. Statistical modeling in R is used to forecast return risks, identify cost inefficiencies, and optimize supply chain decisions based on real-world operational data.


## 🧠 Objectives
- Predict high product return risks using logistic regression
- Analyze profit margins across factories and categories using ANOVA
- Forecast total production and shipping costs with multiple linear regression

## 📂 Folder Structure
- `data/` – Original CSV files from the supply chain dataset
- `cleaned_data/` – RDS files after preprocessing
- `scripts/` – RMarkdown files with code and analysis for each research question

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques
- R (dplyr, ggplot2, glm, lm)
- Logistic Regression
- Linear Regression
- ANOVA
- Confusion Matrix & ROC Curve
- AIC (Model evaluation)

  
## 📈 Key Insights
- Product weight and item quantity significantly influence cost
- Certain warehouses (e.g., W005) are more cost-efficient
- High-return products can be predicted based on the origin factory and sales efficiency
